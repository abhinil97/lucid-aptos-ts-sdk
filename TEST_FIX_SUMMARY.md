# Test Fix Summary

## Issue Description
After implementing comprehensive Move type safety for the Lucid Aptos TypeScript SDK, several tests were failing with the error:

```
TypeError: TransactionBuilder is not a constructor
TypeError: AccountBuilder is not a constructor
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The failing tests were expecting generic `TransactionBuilder` and `AccountBuilder` classes for basic Aptos transaction and account operations. However, our builders module only contained protocol-specific builders for the Hybrid Loan Book (like `OfferLoanSimpleBuilder`, `RepayLoanBuilder`, etc.).

### Test Expectations
The tests were importing:
```typescript
import { TransactionBuilder, AccountBuilder } from '../../src/builders';
```

And expecting these classes to build objects with:

**TransactionBuilder:**
- `sender: string`
- `payload: any`
- `gasLimit: number` 
- `maxGasAmount: number`
- `gasUnitPrice: number`

**AccountBuilder:**
- `address: string`
- `sequenceNumber: string` 
- `authenticationKey: string`

## Solution Implemented

### Minimal Code Addition
Added two simple builder classes to `/src/builders/index.ts`:

```typescript
/**
 * Generic transaction builder for basic Aptos transactions
 */
export class TransactionBuilder {
  private sender: string = '';
  private payload: any = null;
  private gasLimit: number = 2000;
  private maxGasAmount: number = 2000;
  private gasUnitPrice: number = 100;

  setSender(sender: string): this {
    this.sender = sender;
    return this;
  }

  setPayload(payload: any): this {
    this.payload = payload;
    return this;
  }

  setGasLimit(gasLimit: number): this {
    this.gasLimit = gasLimit;
    return this;
  }

  setMaxGasAmount(maxGasAmount: number): this {
    this.maxGasAmount = maxGasAmount;
    return this;
  }

  setGasUnitPrice(gasUnitPrice: number): this {
    this.gasUnitPrice = gasUnitPrice;
    return this;
  }

  build() {
    return {
      sender: this.sender,
      payload: this.payload,
      gasLimit: this.gasLimit,
      maxGasAmount: this.maxGasAmount,
      gasUnitPrice: this.gasUnitPrice,
    };
  }
}

/**
 * Generic account builder for basic Aptos accounts
 */
export class AccountBuilder {
  private address: string = '';
  private sequenceNumber: string = '0';
  private authenticationKey: string = '';

  setAddress(address: string): this {
    this.address = address;
    return this;
  }

  setSequenceNumber(sequenceNumber: string): this {
    this.sequenceNumber = sequenceNumber;
    return this;
  }

  setAuthenticationKey(authenticationKey: string): this {
    this.authenticationKey = authenticationKey;
    return this;
  }

  build() {
    return {
      address: this.address,
      sequenceNumber: this.sequenceNumber,
      authenticationKey: this.authenticationKey,
    };
  }
}
```

### Export Strategy
Also added proper re-exports for all specific builders:

```typescript
// Re-export all specific builders
export * from './loan-creation';
export * from './loan-repayment';
export * from './documents';
export * from './configuration';
export * from './payment-schedule';
```

## Results

### Test Status: ✅ ALL PASSING
```bash
Test Suites: 4 passed, 4 total
Tests:       36 passed, 36 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        1.071 s

## Key Benefits of This Approach

### 1. **Minimal Code Impact**
- Only added ~70 lines of simple builder code
- No changes to existing complex builders
- No changes to type system or validation logic

### 2. **Backward Compatibility**
- Maintains all existing functionality
- Provides expected generic builders for basic operations
- Preserves all protocol-specific builders with enhanced type safety

### 3. **Clean Architecture**
- Generic builders for basic operations
- Protocol-specific builders for Hybrid Loan Book operations
- Clear separation of concerns

### 4. **Future-Proof**
- Easy to extend generic builders if needed
- Maintains flexibility for additional protocols
- Doesn't interfere with existing type safety improvements

## Code Quality Maintained

- **No Linting Errors**: All code passes ESLint validation
- **Type Safety**: Generic builders use simple TypeScript types
- **Fluent API**: Maintains expected builder pattern with method chaining
- **Test Coverage**: All test scenarios now pass successfully

## Conclusion

The test failures were resolved with minimal, targeted additions to the builders module. The solution provides the expected generic builders for basic Aptos operations while preserving all the comprehensive type safety improvements made for the Hybrid Loan Book protocol.

This approach ensures both backward compatibility with existing tests and forward compatibility with the enhanced Move type safety system.
